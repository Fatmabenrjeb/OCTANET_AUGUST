                    studded with islands and archipelagos, a fantastic array of traditions and customs and a rich historical heritage.</p>

                        <p>Hectic resort in summer, well known for its beaches and its party atmosphere, Hammamet is also a small city with an authentic charm. 
                        Turquoise waters, the scent of jasmine, white houses and stone walls gilded by the centuries… its medina fringed by fine sand is particularly 
                        poetic. Nearby, the new resort town of Yasmine Hammamet offers a more contemporary setting, while the forests and lemon groves are a real pleasure 
                        for nature lovers</p>

                                Mahdia is small city which keeps its original traditions, where the women cover themselves with gold jewelry and the houses are decorated 
                                with embroidered hangings. Its monumental gateway calls back to its glorious past: it was the first capital of the great Fatimid dynasty, 
                                who would go on to reign in Egypt and Syria. Its medina stretches out along a narrow peninsula, surrounded by 
                                deep blue waters; its sumptuous beaches delight the tourists. A charming city with many faces.

                        <p>Both Mediterranean and Saharan at once, the island of Djerba has been a source of fascination since the time of Homer. 
                        Ulysses tasted the “lotus” there, a delicious fruit which takes away all desire to leave, and today each visitor feels spellbound 
                        by its exceptional atmosphere; an atmosphere which it shares with Zarzis, its neighbour on the mainland. But Djerba is also an island 
                        of holiday clubs, activities in the fresh air, a unique heritage to discover… and excursions into the majestic setting of the Sahara.</p>

                                Covered by a fine white mantle reminiscent of a snow-covered landscape, the Douz region offers one of the gentlest ways to approach the desert. 
                                Cordons of dunes and graceful bouquets of palm trees fringe the roads the sand slowly reclaims. The golden vastness of the desert is here, 
                                at hand, while the palm groves offer delectable shady places to stop in the forests of date palms. 
                                In the heart of the region, a vast salty expanse with shimmering reflections: the Chott El-Jerid..
